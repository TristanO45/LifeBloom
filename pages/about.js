          I've always been the self-proclaimed tech geek amongst my peers and
          family. Technology has always fascinated me, but my passion truly
          ignited when I joined forces with my gaming buddies to develop 8-bit
          games. My role? Using HTML and CSS to implement the Pok√©mon inspired
          backgrounds and layouts that brought our games to life.

          As I continued my journey to become a programming wizard, I had the
          privilege of working alongside some truly talented engineers.
          Together, we took on challenging projects that made me believe in my
          ability to make a meaningful impact on the world.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I'm not immersed in coding adventures, you'll find me exploring
          my artistic side. I have a deep love for photography, both film and
          digital, and I enjoy capturing awe-inspiring moments with my drone. If
          you're seeking a programmer with a touch of artistry, search no
          further! I'm thrilled to continue learning and growing in this field,
          crafting truly remarkable and practical tools along the way.
